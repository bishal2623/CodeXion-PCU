## Our Project : 
This project is designed for students, parents, teachers, and educational authorities to ensure a transparent and efficient grievance redressal mechanism within educational institutions.

### Project Title :
Student Grievance Support System

### Background :
In educational institutions, students, parents, and teachers often face difficulties in raising and resolving grievances due to the lack of a structured and transparent system. Traditional grievance handling methods are usually manual, time-consuming, and inefficient, leading to delays and poor communication between stakeholders.

### Situation : 
Currently, many institutions rely on offline or unorganized grievance mechanisms where users cannot track the status of their complaints. This results in a lack of accountability, delayed responses, and dissatisfaction among students and parents.

### Objective :
To develop a centralized, web-based Student Grievance Support System that enables secure grievance submission, real-time tracking, and efficient communication between users and authorities, ensuring timely and transparent grievance resolution.

### Aim : 
1. To create a transparent and accountable grievance redressal platform.
2. To reduce grievance resolution time through automation.
3. To improve communication and trust between students and institutional authorities.

### Summary :
The Student Grievance Support System is a web-based platform designed to streamline the grievance redressal process within educational institutions. It allows students, teachers, and parents to submit grievances through a secure login system. The platform routes grievances to the appropriate authority, provides real-time tracking, maintains grievance history, and supports escalation to higher authorities if issues are not resolved within a defined time frame.

### Key Features : 
1. Role-based authentication (Student, Teacher, Parent, Authority)
2. Mandatory user profile creation for effective grievance handling
3. Secure grievance submission with document upload support
4.Real-time grievance status tracking
5. Email and in-app notifications for all activities
6. Complete grievance history and records
7. One-click grievance re-submission if the user is not satisfied
8. Automatic escalation to higher authorities on delay
9. Authority categorization (Department, College, University)
10. Grievance redirection to the correct authority
11. Targeted notice and instruction broadcasting

### Objectives : 
1. Enable secure login-based grievance submission
2. Ensure transparency through real-time status updates
3. Improve accountability using an automated escalation system
4. Reduce manual effort and paperwork
5. Maintain digital records of all grievance-related activities
6. Facilitate effective communication between users and authorities

### System Workflow :
1. User logs in and creates a profile
2. Grievance is submitted with category and supporting documents
3. The grievance is forwarded to the respective authority
4. Authority reviews the grievance and takes necessary action
5. User tracks grievance status in real time
6. If unresolved, the grievance is automatically escalated
